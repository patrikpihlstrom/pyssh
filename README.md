# PYSSH #

Save ssh host configs

### Features ###

This python script will scan your ssh config for the given host. 
If the host wasn't found, you'll be asked if you would like to save the host in your config.

If the host was found, but some of the parameters differ, you'll be asked if you want to update the config.

I recommend creating an alias `alias ssh='python /path/to/pyssh.py'`
